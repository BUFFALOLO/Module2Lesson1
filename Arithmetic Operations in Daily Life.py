# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

# Task 1: Grocery Store Match. Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic.
pizza_dough = 4.99
pizza_sauce = 1.59
pepperoni = 3.89

total = pizza_dough + pizza_sauce + pepperoni
print(total)

# Task 2: Bank Interest. If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. 
# So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.

initial_amount = 15500
INTEREST_RATE = 5

total_amount = INTEREST_RATE * initial_amount / 100
print(total_amount + initial_amount)
